## Welcome to My Website

Below are my Projects using Google API to find 20 nearby restaurants from current location. A marker is created to display all the 20 restaurant's name and address when clicked on it. The current location icon is differentiated from other restaurants icons. This web app is designed in both Javascript and ReactJS.
